  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    An example content implementation guide that illustrates a CPG-on-FHIR approach to
    knowledge engineering applied to Breast Cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concepts in this implementation are extracted from the FHIR translation of the
    currently published Breast Cancer Screening electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM),
    CMS-125. The concepts were abstracted and expressed using CPG-on-FHIR profiles and
    approaches, with the goal of illustrating how shareable libraries of clinical knowledge
    can be used in various domains including quality measurement, decision support, case-reporting,
    and others.
